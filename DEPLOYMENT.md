# ðŸš€ Deployment Guide - Indonesia Super League Football Analytics

This guide will help you deploy your Streamlit football analytics dashboard to Streamlit Cloud.

## Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account**: You need a GitHub account to host your code
2. **Streamlit Cloud Account**: Sign up at [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)

### 1.2 Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it something like `isuperleague-football-analytics`
3. Make it public (required for free Streamlit Cloud deployment)
4. Don't initialize with README (since you already have one)

### 1.3 Push to GitHub
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 2: Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

### 2.1 Sign Up for Streamlit Cloud

**Solution**: Ensure your `data/football_stats.csv` file is committed to GitHub
```bash
git add data/football_stats.csv
git commit -m "Add football statistics data"
git push
```

#### Issue: "Module not found"
**Solution**: Check your `requirements.txt` includes all dependencies
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
git add requirements.txt
git commit -m "Update requirements"
git push
```

#### Issue: "App not loading"
**Solution**: Check the deployment logs in Streamlit Cloud dashboard
